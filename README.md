# Early Detection of Dementia Project

## Overview
This project aims to perform early detection of dementia in patients. Specifically, the project targets the detection of two types of diseases: Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. 

## Dataset Augmentation
Due to a lack of sufficient dataset, we have utilized four generative models to augment the existing data. This augmentation process is intended to enhance the generalization and robustness of our classification models. The generative models employed in this project are:

1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
2. Diffusion Models
3. Data Efficient GAN
4. Variational Autoencoders

## Contents
- **Generative Model Training Files**: This directory contains the sample training files for the generative models mentioned above.
- **Classification Model Training and Inference Files**: Here, you'll find the necessary files for training and performing inference with our classification models.

## Future Work
We are in the process of developing a complete pipeline to streamline the training and inference processes. Once completed, this pipeline will facilitate a seamless workflow, potentially leading to the development of a robust Python package.

Stay tuned for updates on our progress!
